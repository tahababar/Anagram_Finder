# Anagram_Finder
Project for CS233 Foundations of Computation class


This is an efficient implementation of (multi-)sets of ASCII characters to find anagrams of words. The program allows the user to enter a word; it  then reads a list of valid English words and print out all of them that are anagrams of the input.

ENABLE word list, which is a freely distributable collection of more than 170,000 words: https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/download/enable.txt is used. This is a text file with one word per line.
